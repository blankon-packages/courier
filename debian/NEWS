    The scripts makesmtpaccess, makeacceptmailfor, makehosteddomains, and
    makepercentrelay now ignore files conforming to the regex patterns
    ".*\.dpkg-[a-z]*" and ".*~". Please check whether your configuration
    relies on such files and rename them if required.

courier (0.66.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

    The format of the autoreplies has changed. Autoreply content must now
    use flowed-text markup. This affects mailbot and the equivalent
    autoreply feature in sqwebmail. Existing mailbot autoreply files need
    to be edited and reformatted as flowed text. Ditto for autoreplies set
    up in sqwebmail. They need to be opened, and edited so that the only
    linebreaks occur between paragraphs. Additionally, the autoreply text
    in sqwebmail is now saved in UTF-8; existing autoreplies may need to
    be transcoded manually.

courier-imap (0.58.0.20080127-1) unstable; urgency=low

    Mismatches between ownership of the mailbox directory and the
    ownership retrieved from the account database can cause mysterious
    error messages. To prevent these a sanity check was added to Courier
    IMAP. Such mismatches trigger the following error on login: 
  
    BYE [ALERT] Fatal error: Account's mailbox directory is not owned 
    by the correct uid or gid

    The sanity check can be averted by setting IMAP_MAILBOX_SANITY_CHECK
    in /etc/courier/imapd to 0 and restart Courier IMAP.

courier (0.53.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

    Beginning with Courier 0.48, the authentication modules that used to
    be part of Courier have been separated into a standalone library. All
    Courier applications are now using the same authentication
    infrastructure, the Courier authentication library. Packages for this
    library consists of a base package (courier-authlib) and one for each
    authentication method (courier-authlib-userdb, -mysql, -postgresql,
    -ldap, -pipe). Unfortunately it wasn't possible to setup the
    dependencies in order to allow a seamless upgrade. Please install the
    package for your authentication method manually.

courier (0.45.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

    /etc/courier/authmodulelist has been deprecated, you can remove this file
    backed out patch to quell FAM error messages, we just suppress them
    now as suggested by upstream. If you want to use FAM for the IMAP IDLE
    command, please make sure that it works. You wouldn't get any notice 
    about that in the logs.
