Template: sqwebmail/calendarmode
Type: select
__Choices: local, net, disabled
Default: local
_Description: Calendaring mode:
 Please specify if you would like to enable calendaring in 'local' mode,
 enable groupware or 'net' mode or disable it.
 The courier-pcp package is required to use the groupware mode.
 .
 Local mode adds very little overhead over a disabled calendaring
 mode. On the other hand, groupware mode is less resources-friendly and
 requires a separate daemon process to be run.
 .
 For more information, please refer to /usr/share/doc/sqwebmail/PCP.html.

Template: sqwebmail/dictionary
Type: select
Choices: ${DICTS}
Default: default
_Description: Ispell dictionary:
 SqWebMail allows you to spellcheck your emails. Please select an
 appropriate dictionary for ispell.

Template: sqwebmail/install-www
Type: select
_Choices: symlink, copy, custom
Default: symlink
_Description: Installation method for HTML documents and images:
 The HTML documents and images in /usr/share/sqwebmail can be made
 accessible at /var/www/sqwebmail via a symbolic link; or by being
 copied directly into a directory there; or not at all.
 .
 The 'copy' option is recommended for security reasons. However, if
 'FollowSymLinks' or 'SymLinksIfOwnerMatch' are already enabled in
 Apache configuration, the first option can be considered. The last
 option needs manual actions to configure the web server.
 .
 Please note that /var/www/sqwebmail will be removed if this package is
 purged unless the 'custom' option is chosen.

Template: sqwebmail/install-www-backup
Type: string
Description: for internal use
