     The SSL mess

  Introducing WebMLM

   New in Courier 0.56 is the finished version of WebMLM. WebMLM is a
   web-based interface to couriermlm-managed mailing lists. WebMLM implements
   nearly all of couriermlm's functionality through a web browser.

   Due to that, couriermlm's template files have changed. After upgrading to
   this version, you must make a backup copy of all of your customizations to
   couriermlm's template files, run couriermlm update against each mailing
   list directory, then reapply your custom template changes. This is
   mandatory even if you do not plan on using WebMLM.

  The SSL mess

   The default SSL3 setting for TLS_PROTOCOL (and SSL_PROTOCOL, in some
   cases) in the various services' configuration files (esmtp, imap, pop3,
   and webmail) no longer accepts legacy SSL2 connections. If you need legacy
   compatibility with SSL2, change the appropriate setting from SSL3 to
   SSL23.
