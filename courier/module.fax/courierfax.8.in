.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
courierfax
module (if enabled by the system administrator) sends E\-mail messages by fax\&. Addressing an E\-mail message to the address
5558888@fax
faxes a printed copy of the message to the specified phone number\&.
.PP
The ability to send faxes may be restricted, or not available\&. The E\-mail message may be a MIME\-formatted message\&. All attachments are concatenated and sent together in a single fax transmission\&.
courierfax
only knows how to handle certain kinds of attached\&. Obviously, trying to fax a voice
\&.mp3
attaching is not going to work\&.
courierfax
knows how to handle plain text, Postscript, and PDF MIME attachments\&.
courierfax
might also know what to do with other kinds of attachment, depending on some optional software installed by the system administrator\&.
courierfax
may also be able to read
GIF,
PNG, and
JPEG
images\&.

.PP
Images are faxed with one image per fax page (limiting image sizes to about 1600x2200)\&.
.PP
The message will be returned as undeliverable if
courierfax
doesn\*(Aqt know how to handle a MIME attachment\&. If the first MIME section in the E\-mail message is plain text, the text appears on the fax cover page\&. The sender/recipient information for the cover page is taken from the message\*(Aqs headers\&.
.PP
The default
courierfax
configuration tries to resend the fax for up to eight hours, after which the message is returned as undeliverable\&. The message will also be returned as undeliverable if the fax transmission is interrupted\&. The return bounce will state how many pages were successfully transmitted\&.

"@fax" may also be followed by additional keywords that specify extra options:

Send a cover page only\&. This is useful in limited situations, with something like this in a

file:

This
\&.courier
file faxes the contents of a message, sans any attachments, immediately upon receipt in addition to saving the message in the mailbox\&.
.RE
.SH "FAX TRANSMISSION RECEIPT"
.PP
The sender will receive a fax transmission receipt if the sender requests an ESMTP delivery status notification\&. This is the
\fB\-N\fR
option to
\m[blue]\fB\fBsendmail\fR(8)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2:

.if n \{\
.RE

.PP
When using other mail software, consult the mail software\*(Aqs documentation for instructions on requesting ESMTP delivery status notifications\&.
.SH "ADDITIONAL DIALING OPTIONS"
.PP
courierfax
configurations that are generated by the
\fBwebadmin\fR
tool for North American environments usually restrict phone numbers to a standardized ten\-digit telephone number, so that the fax address is always <\fIaaabbbcccc\fR@fax>, and
courierfax
silently performs any needed conversion to dial the number (such as adding
\(lq1\(rq
or dropping the local areacode)\&.
.PP
It is also possible to reconfigure
courierfax
so that it accepts any telephone string and dials it without any preprocessing\&. If so, the address may contain any combination of digits, letters
\(lqA\(rq,
\(lqB\(rq,
\(lqC\(rq, and
\(lqD\(rq, representing the four extra dialing tones not normally accessible from most telephone keypads, the symbols
\(lq*\(rq
and
\(lq#\(rq, or the following characters:
.PP
W
.RS 4
Most faxmodems pause and wait for a secondary dialtone, before dialing the rest of the number\&.
.RE
.PP
\-
.RS 4
The dash is replaced by a comma in the dialing string\&. A comma results in most faxmodems pausing for two or three seconds before dialing the rest of the number\&. It is not possible to enter a comma directly, because commas are used to separate multiple E\-mail addresses\&. Use dashes instead of commas in the dialing string\&.
courierfax
replaces all dashes with commas before dialing the faxmodem\&.
.RE
.PP
+
.RS 4
Similarly,
courierfax
replaces all pluses with
\(lq@\(rq
characters before dialing\&. An
\(lq@\(rq
characters results in most faxmodems waiting for the line to be silent for five seconds before dialing the rest of the number\&. It is not possible to enter a
\(lq@\(rq
directly as part of the telephone number itself, for the obvious reasons\&. Use pluses instead of
\(lq@\(rqs in the dialing string\&.
courierfax
replaces all pluses with
\(lq@\(rq
before dialing the faxmodem\&.
.RE
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.PP
The slightly arcane configuration file,
@sysconfdir@/faxrc, sets up which dialing strings are valid\&. The default configuration file contains judicious comments that explain all the parameters, and what they do\&. The default configuration file disables
courierfax
by rejecting all telephone numbers\&. The file must be edited in accordance with the embedded instructions, in order to enable faxing\&.
.PP
Using
\fBwebadmin\fR
is highly recommended\&. Upon demand,
\fBwebadmin\fR
will install a suitable configuration file for the North American numbering plan, that receives all telephone numbers as ten\-digit numbers, and adds any required long distance prefix, or removes the local area code, as appropriate\&. Or,
\fBwebadmin\fR
will install a bare\-bones configuration file that dials any requested phone number, without any editing or transformation\&.
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
There is no good way to sleep until a modem lock is released, so we poll every minute\&.
