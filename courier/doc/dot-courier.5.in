dot-courier \- Local mail delivery instructions
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
$HOME/\&.courier

$HOME/\&.courier\-foo

@sysconfdir@/aliasdir/\&.courier\-foo
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
In most cases delivering mail to an account means simply placing the message in the account\*(Aqs system mailbox, but that does not have to be the case\&. Alternate mail delivery instructions include running a separate program to process the message, or forwarding the message to another address\&. The various
\&.courier
files specify some basic mail delivery instructions\&. If sophisticated mail filtering is required, the delivery instructions should include running an external mail filter, such as
\m[blue]\fB\fBmaildrop\fR(1)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2\&.
.PP
The file
$HOME/\&.courier
specifies how messages are delivered to this account\&. If this file does not exist, default instructions set by the system administrator are used\&. The system administrator\*(Aqs default instructions specify the location of the account\*(Aqs system mailbox\&.
.PP
In addition to receiving mail addressed
user@domain, it is also possible for
user
to receive mail addressed to
user\-\fIfoo\fR@domain, for arbitrary values of
\fIfoo\fR\&. To do this, install
$HOME/\&.courier\-\fIfoo\fR, with delivery instructions for mail addressed to
user\-foo@domain\&.
.PP
The system administrator can configure the
Courier
mail server to accept mail without regard to whether addresses are in uppercase and lowercase\&. In that case the name of a
\&.courier
file must contain only lowercase characters\&. In any event, all periods in the address must be replaced with colons\&. For example, to specify delivery instructions for
user\-Foo\&.Bar@domain, put the delivery instructions in
~user/\&.courier\-foo:bar\&.
.PP
The file
$HOME/\&.courier\-foo\-default
specifies delivery instructions for any
user\-foo\-\fIbar\fR@domain
address, where
\fIbar\fR
can be anything\&. However, it does NOT control mail delivery to
user\-foo@domain, which is controlled by
$HOME/\&.courier\-foo\&.
.PP
Possible mail delivery instructions include: whether each message should be delivered to a non\-standard mailbox; forwarded to another E\-mail address; or if another program should be executed to handle the message\&. Programs executed from a
\&.courier
file have access to some environment variables (see ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES)\&. Programs executed from a
\-default
file can read those environment variables to determine the exact E\-mail address the message was delivered to\&.
.SS "Default delivery instructions"
.PP
The
@sysconfdir@/aliasdir
directory is searched as the last resort, when all attempts to figure out how to deliver mail to a local address have failed\&.
.PP
@sysconfdir@/aliasdir\*(Aqs functionality is very similar to how the
alias
account is implemented in Qmail, except that no actual system account is needed\&. If
<user@example\&.com>
is a local address, and there is no such system account, nor is there an alias defined for this address, the
Courier
mail server attempts to read delivery instructions from
@sysconfdir@/aliasdir/\&.courier\-user\&.
.PP
All the usual aspects of
\&.courier
deliveries apply\&. If there is no account that corresponds to the address
<user\-foo@example\&.com>, the
Courier
mail server looks for
@sysconfdir@/aliasdir/\&.courier\-user\-foo, then
@sysconfdir@/aliasdir/\&.courier\-user\-default, and finally
@sysconfdir@/aliasdir/\&.courier\-default\&.
.PP
It therefore follows that you can use
@sysconfdir@/aliasdir/\&.courier\-default
to specify local mail delivery instructions for addresses that do not exist\&. Combined with dynamic mail delivery instructions (see below), that\*(Aqs one way to specify non\-standard locations of mailboxes\&.
.SS "Program/mailbox aliases"
.PP
The directory
@sysconfdir@/aliasdir/\&.courier\-:xalias/
is created and maintained by the
\m[blue]\fB\fBmakealiases\fR(8)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2
script to implement aliases that deliver directly to programs or mailboxes\&. See
\m[blue]\fB\fBmakealiases\fR(8)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2
for more information\&. (This directory corresponds to local addresses that begin with "\&.xalias/", but the
Courier
mail server prohibits explicit local addresses that begin with a period)\&.
.PP
Additionally,
\m[blue]\fB\fBmakealiases\fR(8)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2
creates subdirectories named
@sysconfdir@/aliasdir/\&.courier\-:xalias\-\fIprotocol\fR/, where "\fIprotocol\fR" is set by the
\fB\-m\fR
option\&.
.SS "DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS"
.PP
Each
\&.courier
file specifies zero or more delivery instructions\&. If the
\&.courier
file is zero bytes long, it means that default mail delivery instructions set by the system administrator should be used\&. If the file is not a zero length file, and does not specify any delivery instructions, messages to the corresponding E\-mail address are silently discarded\&.

If
$HOME/\&.courier
does not exist, it is treated as a zero\-length file, resulting in a delivery to a default mailbox\&. If
$HOME/\&.courier\-foo
does not exist, it is treated as a non\-existent address, returning the message as undeliverable\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.PP
If home directories have global read and execute permissions, the
Courier
mail server will be able to reject mail to non\-existent mailboxes right away\&. the
Courier
mail server\*(Aqs ESMTP server runs as a non\-privileged process\&. It will not be able to access home directories which do not have global read and execute permissions\&. Therefore, the message will be accepted for delivery, by the
Courier
mail server\&. As soon as an attempt to deliver the message is made, the missing
\&.courier
file will result in the message being returned as undeliverable\&. However, here the
Courier
mail server has to accept the message for delivery first, before generating a non\-delivery report\&.
.PP
Delivery instructions in
\&.courier
are executed one at a time\&. If the execution of a delivery instruction fails for some reason, the message is either returned as undeliverable, or requeued for another delivery attempt\&. Messages that remain queued for a long period of time are returned as undeliverable\&.

Even if one delivery instruction fails (and the message is returned as undeliverable) previous delivery instructions in the file will have been completed anyway\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.PP
Blank lines in the file are ignored\&. Lines starting with the # character are comments, and are also ignored\&. Otherwise, each line specifies one of three possible delivery instructions: deliver to a system mailbox or a Maildir; run an external program; or forward the message to another address\&.
.SS "DELIVERY TO A SYSTEM MAILBOX OR A MAILDIR"
.PP
Lines that start with the
\&.
or the
/
character specify a mailbox or a Maildir delivery\&. The line must specify the complete location of the mailbox file, or a Maildir\&. Filenames starting with
\&.
are relative to the account\*(Aqs home directory\&. A mailbox file is a traditional mailbox file that\*(Aqs readable by most mail software\&. A Maildir is a directory based mail storage format that offers several advantages over mailbox files\&. Mailbox files must be locked, and therefore they do not permit concurrent mail deliveries\&. The mailbox file must be locked while a new message is appended to it, otherwise multiple messages being delivered at the same time will trample all over each other\&. Maildirs do not require locking, and multiple concurrent deliveries can be made to the same Maildir\&. You can create Maildirs by using the
\m[blue]\fB\fBmaildirmake\fR(1)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[3]\d\s+2
command\&.

The
Courier
mail server does not implement the "dot\-locking" form of mailbox file locking\&. The
Courier
mail server\*(Aqs locking abilities are limited solely to system file locking facilities (namely the
\fBlockf\fR, or
\fBflock\fR
system calls)\&. You can always use
\m[blue]\fB\fBmaildrop\fR(1)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2, which offers additional locking options\&.

.RE
.SS "RUNNING AN EXTERNAL PROGRAM"
.PP
Lines that begin with a single
|
character run an external program\&. The rest of the line specifies the command to be executed by the shell\&. Long commands can be continued on another line by terminating the previous line with the
\e
character\&.
.PP
The
Courier
mail server runs the specified command, and provides the contents of the message on standard input\&.
.PP
The
Courier
mail server waits until the external command completes execution before going to the next delivery instruction\&. The
Courier
mail server examines the exit code of the external command in order to determine whether the delivery failed, or not\&.
.PP
If the external command terminates with the exit code of zero, the next delivery instruction is executed\&. If the command was the last delivery instruction in the file, the message is considered to be successfully delivered\&.
.PP
If the external command terminates with the exit code of
\fB99\fR, any additional delivery instructions in the file are NOT executed, but the message is considered to be successfully delivered\&.
.PP
If the external command terminates with the
\(lqEX_SOFTWARE\(rq
exit code, which is usually 70, on most platforms, the E\-mail message gets returned as undeliverable, a non\-delivery report, and no further delivery instructions takes place\&.
.PP
If the external command terminates with any of the following exit codes:
\fB64\fR,
\fB65\fR,
\fB67\fR,
\fB68\fR,
\fB69\fR,
\fB76\fR,
\fB77\fR,
\fB78\fR,
\fB100\fR, or
\fB112\fR, the delivery attempt is considered to be failed, and the next course of action gets selected by
Courier
mail server\*(Aqs backscatter suppression settings, as described in the
\(lq\m[blue]\fBBackscatter Suppression\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[4]\d\s+2\(rq
section of the installation instructions; see
\m[blue]\fB\fBcourier\fR(8)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[5]\d\s+2
for more information\&.
.PP
If the external command terminates with any other exit code, it is interpreted as a temporary error, and the message will be requeued for another delivery attempt later\&.

.RE
.SS "DYNAMIC DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS"
.PP
Lines that begin with the
||
characters also run an external program\&. The rest of the line specifies the command to be executed by the shell\&. Long commands can be continued on another line by terminating the previous line with the
\e
character\&.
.PP
However, programs that are executed by the
||
instruction, unlike
|, have their standard output captured, and reinterpreted as additional delivery instructions to be carried out\&. This feature allows an external program to be invoked to generate dynamic delivery instructions to be carried out by the
Courier
mail server\&.
.PP
The standard output of the external program is read and parsed as if it contained
\&.courier
delivery instructions\&. There\*(Aqs a fixed upper limit on the number of bytes in dynamically\-generated delivery instructions\&. For
glibc, the limit is 8191 bytes, other systems\*(Aqs upper limit should be similar\&.
.PP
The dynamically generated delivery instructions may also specify
||
instructions, recursively\&. There is an upper limit of four recursive dynamically\-generated delivery instructions\&.
.PP
The exit code of the program invoked by the
||
instructions are interpreted exactly like the exit code of a program invoked by
|, with the following exceptions\&. Dynamically\-generated delivery instructions are carried out only if the external program terminates with an exit code of
\fB0\fR
or
\fB99\fR\&. Any other exit code discards any dynamically\-generated delivery instructions\&. All other aspects of exit code treatment of external programs remains the same\&. If the exit code is
\fB99\fR, the delivery is deemed to be successful, and any additional instructions in the original
\&.courier
file are ignored\&. If the exit code is
\fB0\fR, the remaining instructions in the original
\&.courier
file are executed\&.
.SS "Alias\-based deliveries"
.PP
When the
Courier
mail server delivers to default delivery instructions in
@sysconfdir@/aliasdir, those delivery instructions are carried out under the
Courier
mail server\*(Aqs installed system user and group id\&. That means that any executed programs or mailboxes are accessed as the
Courier
mail server\*(Aqs mail system user and group\&.
.SS "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"

\m[blue]\fB\fBpreline\fR(1)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[6]\d\s+2

mail server to recognize
\fBmaildrop\fR, and activate certain
\fBmaildrop\fR\-specific optimizations in the
Courier
mail server\&. If these arrangemenets have been made, you can run
\fBmaildrop\fR
directly from the
\&.courier
file, in a straightforward fashion, but those headers will automatically appear in the message, as seen by
\fBmaildrop\fR\&. Because the message is provided directly on standard input, without using a pipe,
\fBmaildrop\fR

.RE
.SS "FORWARDING"
.PP
Lines that do not start with the

or the
!

.SH "BUGS"
.PP
The
Courier
mail server\*(Aqs
\&.courier
may seem to be exactly like Qmail\*(Aqs
\&.qmail, but there are some minor differences\&. Qmail, as of 1\&.03, does not implement dynamic delivery instructions\&. The
Courier
mail server also uses a slightly different set of return codes which are classified as hard errors\&. The
Courier
mail server\*(Aqs implementation of forwarding differs from Qmail\*(Aqs\&. According to Qmail\*(Aqs documentation, if any external command terminates in a permanent or temporary failure, the message is not forwarded to any forwarding address in the
\&.qmail
file, even to addresses that precede the failed delivery instruction\&. The message is forwarded only after it is successfully delivered\&. The
Courier
mail server forwards messages to addresses immediately\&. Also, in some cases Qmail resets the return address on the message to the address of the account being forwarded\&.
.PP
To make things more confusing, there is a configuration setting to have the
Courier
mail server read
$HOME/\&.qmail
files, instead of
$HOME/\&.courier\&.
