couriermlm \- The Courier mailing list manager
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBcouriermlm\fR\ 'u
\fBcouriermlm\fR {\fIcommand\fR} {\fIdirectory\fR} [\fIarg\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBcouriermlm\fR
is the
Courier
mail server\*(Aqs mailing list manager\&. This command sets up, maintains, and manages mailing lists\&.
\fBcouriermlm\fR
automatically handles requests to subscribe and unsubscribe list members, detects undeliverable addresses and removes them from the subscription rolls\&. Mailing lists managed by
\fBcouriermlm\fR
require zero human administrative oversight\&.
\fBcouriermlm\fR
supports digests, write\-only posting aliases, and moderated mailing lists\&.
.SS "CREATING A MAILING LIST"
.PP
Anyone can use
\fBcouriermlm\fR, not just the system administrator\&. The
Courier
mail server mail server translates an address
list\-name@domain
as a local address with a corresponding
\m[blue]\fB\fBdot-courier\fR(5)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
file\&. Anyone that can install a
\m[blue]\fB\fBdot-courier\fR(5)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
file, and can schedule
\fBcron\fR(8)
jobs, can run a
\fBcouriermlm\fR
mailing list\&.
.PP
Note that the system administrator can optionally remove the
\m[blue]\fB\fBdot-courier\fR(5)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
support from the the
Courier
mail server\&.
\fBcouriermlm\fR
will not work in that case\&.
.PP
Setting up a mailing list consists of the following steps:
.PP
Run \fBcouriermlm create\fR
.RS 4
Use this command to create a directory where
\fBcouriermlm\fR
keeps all mailing list related files\&.
.RE
.PP
Configure the mailing list
.RS 4
The
\fBcouriermlm create\fR
command initializes the mailing list subdirectory with some default template responses\&. It is necessary to customize them for your mailing list, and it may be necessary to issue some additional commands in order to configure appropriate mailing list options \-\- such as enabling unrestricted posting privileges, and enabling moderation\&.
.RE
.PP
Create \m[blue]\fB\fBdot-courier\fR(5)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2 files
.RS 4
Set up to run
\fBcouriermlm\fR
to distribute mailing list messages, and process requests\&.
.RE
.PP
Set up \fBcron\fR(8)
.RS 4
You need to set up
\fBcron\fR(8)
jobs to run the
\fBcouriermlm hourly\fR
and
\fBcouriermlm daily\fR
commands, which perform regular mailing list maintenance\&.
.RE
.PP
Back up subscription lists
.RS 4
As part of your daily job you should also run the
\fBexport\fR
command, in order to back up the mailing list subscriber information\&. In the event that the mailing list database gets corrupted or lost, you can restore it from this backup file\&. See the
\fBexport\fR
command for more information\&.

.PP
Setting up a digest for the mailing list requires additional steps\&. See "\m[blue]\fBSetting up a mailing list digest\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2" below for more information\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.PP
The first step is to run the following command:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
couriermlm create \fIdirectory\fR ADDRESS=\fIlist@domain\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
\fIdirectory\fR
is the mailing list directory that will be managed by
\fBcouriermlm\fR\&. This directory should not be created in advance, this command creates this directory, and initializes it\&.
.PP
\fIlist@domain\fR
is the mailing list\*(Aqs address, the address that sends messages to the mailing list\&.
.PP
An additional setting,
URL
may also be specified:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
couriermlm create \fIdirectory\fR ADDRESS=\fIlist@domain\fR URL=\fIurl\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
\(lqurl\(rq
would be the
URL
of the
WebMLM
web page for this mailing list\&. See
\m[blue]\fB\fBwebmlmd\fR(1)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[3]\d\s+2
for more information\&.
.PP
The directory created by
\fBcouriermlm create\fR
is initialized to contain a number of text files that
\fBcouriermlm\fR
sends back as replies to administrative commands\&. It is necessary to edit these template files and adjust the text in those files for this mailing list\&. All template filenames end with
\&.tmpl, and their contents are self explanatory\&. Some important template files are:
.PP
help\&.tmpl
.RS 4
This text is returned in response to the help command\&. This text must be modified depending upon whether this mailing list is a moderated mailing list, has a digest version, or if any other non\-default configuration options are set for the mailing list\&.
.RE
.PP
sub\&.tmpl
.RS 4
This is the reply that\*(Aqs sent back in response to a subscription request\&. Less important is
unsub\&.tmpl, which is the response to a request to unsubscribe\&.
.RE
.PP
sub2\&.tmpl
.RS 4
This is the successful subscription confirmation\&. A brief overview of the mailing list might be appropriate here\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBcouriermlm\fR
has rudimentary support for non\-English templates\&. The
\fBcouriermlm create\fR
command has a single, optional parameter,
\fB\-\-lang=\fR\fB\fIsuffix\fR\fR
The option must be specified after the mailing list directory\*(Aqs name:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
couriermlm create \fIdirectory\fR \-\-lang=es ADDRESS=\fIlist@domain\fR URL=\fIurl\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The templates for the stock text files come from
@datadir@/couriermlm\&. This directory contains all the
*\&.tmpl
and
*\&.html
template files that
\fBcouriermlm create\fR
installs in the new mailing list
\fIdirectory\fR\&.
.PP
Translated versions of template files are installed in the same directory,
@datadir@/couriermlm\&. The translated version of
\fIfile\fR
must be installed as
\fIfile\fR\&.\fIsuffix\fR, for example:
help\&.tmpl\&.es
is the translated version of
help\&.tmpl, with the
\(lqes\(rq
suffix\&.
.PP
The
\fB\-\-lang=\fR\fB\fIsuffix\fR\fR
option installs the the
\&.suffix
version of each text template file, if available\&. If not, the stock English template file gets copied, as usual\&.
.if n \{\
.sp
.\}
.RS 4
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
\fBNote\fR
.ps -1
.br
.PP
Do not remove the English template files, even if you never use them\&. They must be left in place, in
@datadir@/couriermlm, for
\fBcouriermlm create\fR
to work correctly\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.PP
Example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
couriermlm create /home/lists/users\-list \-\-lang=es \&.\&.\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
This example installs the
*\&.es
versions of mailing list template files\&. Only the stock, English template files come with the
Courier
mail server\&. This mechanism only provides an easy integration ability with template files from other sources\&.
.PP
There are some additional configuration files that can be modified to suit your taste:
.PP
headeradd
.RS 4
This file can be initialized to contain any mail headers that will be automatically added to every mailing list message\&. The contents of this file are simply prepended to every message that goes out\&. Blank lines are not allowed\&.
.RE
.PP
headerdel
.RS 4
This file lists any headers that will be automatically removed from every mailing list message before it\*(Aqs sent\&. List each header one per line, including the : character\&. For example, to remove all
\fIReceived:\fR
and
\fIDate:\fR
headers from every message, initialize this file to contain the following two lines:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Received:
Date:
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.PP
Both the
headeradd
and
headerdel
files can be used to implement a popular feature of setting the replies to every message to go to the mailing list\&. Having "Reply\-To:" in
headerdel, removes any existing
\fIReply\-To:\fR
header, and then having "Reply\-To: \fIlist@domain\fR" in
headeradd
appends a fixed
\fIReply\-To:\fR
header to every message\&.
.PP
The
\fIcreate\fR
command also creates the following subdirectories in the mailing list directory:
.PP
sublist
.RS 4
This subdirectory has the database files that contain the mailing list\*(Aqs subscription list\&.
.RE
.PP
unsublist
.RS 4
This subdirectory stores files that contain information about addresses that have been unsubscribed from the mailing list\&. This information might be of some use when tracking down an old subscription\&. The contents of this directory are not automatically purged, you must set up your own purging mechanism for this directory\&.
.RE
.PP
commands, commands\&.dat
.RS 4
These directories store temporary files that contain pending (unconfirmed) commands for the mailing list manager\&. The
\fBcouriermlm\fR
commands
\fIhourly\fR
and
\fIdaily\fR
must be executed regularly in order to periodically purge stale entries\&.
.RE
.PP
modqueue
.RS 4
Messages awaiting moderator approval (for moderated lists)\&.
.RE
.PP
archive
.RS 4
Messages received by this mailing list will be stored here, in addition to being forwarded to subscribers\&.
\fBcouriermlm\fR
does not automatically do any purging on this subdirectory, you must set up your own archiving mechanism that cleans out this subdirectory\&.
.RE
.PP
The last step involves installing a couple of
\m[blue]\fB\fBdot-courier\fR(5)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
files that run
\fBcouriermlm\fR
to receive mailing list messages and administrative commands\&. The mailing list address,
\fIlist@domain\fR, corresponds to some
\m[blue]\fB\fBdot-courier\fR(5)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
file\&. For example, if your system account is
\fIjohn\fR, and your mail domain is
\fIexample\&.com\fR, then the
\m[blue]\fB\fBdot-courier\fR(5)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
file for the mailing list
\fI<john\-list@example\&.com>\fR
is
$HOME/\&.courier\-list\&.
.PP
Let\*(Aqs say that the
\m[blue]\fB\fBdot-courier\fR(5)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
file is
$HOME/\&.courier\-list\&. To properly support the mailing list, the following
\m[blue]\fB\fBdot-courier\fR(5)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
files will have to be initialized as follows:
.PP
$HOME/\&.courier\-list
.RS 4
This file should be initialized to contain the following delivery instruction:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
| @bindir@/couriermlm msg \fIdirectory\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
\fIdirectory\fR
is the created mailing list directory\&.
.RE
.PP
$HOME/\&.courier\-list\-owner
.RS 4
This file should contain the appropriate delivery instructions for forwarding all mail addressed to
<list\-owner@domain>
to the address of the owner of the mailing list\&. This can be another E\-mail address, or a mailbox specification\&.
.RE
.PP
$HOME/\&.courier\-list\-default
.RS 4
This file should be initialized to contain the following delivery instruction:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
| @bindir@/couriermlm ctlmsg \fIdirectory\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
\fIdirectory\fR
is the created mailing list directory\&. This
\m[blue]\fB\fBdot-courier\fR(5)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
file provides support for all other addresses of the form
<list\-\fIcommand\fR@domain>, where
\fIcommand\fR
is a mailing list administrative command\&. Commands are sent to this mailing list manager by sending a message to one of several special addresses, described more fully in "\m[blue]\fBMailing list commands\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[4]\d\s+2", below\&.

.RE
.PP
The main mailing list is supported by three
\m[blue]\fB\fBdot-courier\fR(5)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
files, as previously described: the posting address, the owner forwarding address, and the default address that handles administrative control messages\&. In the following example, the names
$HOME/\&.courier\-list,
$HOME/\&.courier\-list\-owner, and
$HOME/\&.courier\-list\-default
are used to represent each one of these files, and the following names are used to represent the
\m[blue]\fB\fBdot-courier\fR(5)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
files that correspond to the digest version of the mailing list:
$HOME/\&.courier\-list\-digest,
$HOME/\&.courier\-list\-digest\-owner, and
$HOME/\&.courier\-list\-digest\-default\&. Note, however, that the digest version of the mailing list can have any name, not necessary the name of the list, followed by "digest"\&.
.PP
The contents of both
$HOME/\&.courier\-list
$HOME/\&.courier\-list\-digest
must be the same\&. Sending a message to the digest address should really end up sending a message to the main mailing list\&. Do not put the address of the digest mailing list directory in
$HOME/\&.courier\-list\-digest, instead specify the address of the main mailing list directory\&. Just copy
$HOME/\&.courier\-list
to
$HOME/\&.courier\-list\-digest\&.
.PP
However, the contents of
$HOME/\&.courier\-list\-digest\-default
must specify the directory of the digest version of the mailing list\&. The digest list is managed separately from the main list, it has its own subscriber list that is separate from the list of subscribers to the main list\&.
$HOME/\&.courier\-list\-default
can simply be copied to
$HOME/\&.courier\-list\-digest\-default, then the directory can be changed in the latter\&.
.PP
$HOME/\&.courier\-list\-owner
may use the same mailing list owner address as
$HOME/\&.courier\-list\-digest\-owner, or it can specify a different address\&. The both the digest and the main mailing list can have the same mailing list owner/moderator, or have a different owner/moderator\&.
.PP
The following command must be executed in order to link the two lists together:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
@bindir@/couriermlm set \e
    \fI/path/to/main/list/directory\fR \e
    DIGEST=\fI/path/to/digest/list/directory\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Setting the
DIGEST
option on the main list lets
\fBcouriermlm\fR
know that a digest version is available\&. The
DIGEST
option must either use an absolute pathname, or a pathname that\*(Aqs relative to the main list directory (NOT the current directory)\&.
.PP
When the
DIGEST
option is set, messages are simultaneously distributed to the mailing list\*(Aqs subscribers, saved in the
archive
subdirectory of the main list, then placed in the
modqueue
subdirectory of the digest list\&. Digest list do not employ moderation \-\- any moderation must take place on the main list \-\- so the
modqueue
subdirectory is recycled to compile individual messages for the digest\&.
.PP
Finally, something needs to be done in order to actually distribute the digest to the digest list\*(Aqs subscribers\&. This is done by running the following command:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
@bindir@/couriermlm digest \fI/path/to/digest/directory\fR \fIN\fR \fIH\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
This command creates a digest, and sends it out\&. The
\fIN\fR
and
\fIH\fR
arguments are optional\&. The digest is created only if there\*(Aqs at least
\fIN\fR
messages that are waiting to be sent in the digest list, or if the oldest message is at least
\fIH\fR
hours old\&. Both options default to 0, so the default behavior is to send a digest with all unsent messages\&.
.PP
Note that when the digest is created, ALL unsent messages are packaged into the digest, even if some messages are more recent than the time interval specified by the
\fIH\fR
option\&. A
\fBcron\fR(8)
job can be set up to run the
\fIdigest\fR
command, or run it manually\&.
.PP
\fBcouriermlm\fR
automatically provides the
From:,
To:
headers on a message digest\&. Additional headers may be specified by the
headeradd
file in the digest list directory\&. The
headerdel
file has no effect\&. Note that the individual messages in the digest are copies of the messages from the main mailing list, and thus have the
headeradd
and
headerdel
headers processed from the main mailing list directory\&.
