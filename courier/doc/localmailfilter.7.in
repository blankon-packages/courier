.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBmaildrop\fR
mail filter can be used by the
Courier
mail server as a mail filtering engine, rejecting unwanted mail on a per\-recipient basis\&.
.PP
The actual filtering interface used by the
Courier
mail server does not really require that
\fBmaildrop\fR
must be used as a mail filtering engine, it just so happens that
\fBmaildrop\fR
has a compatible interface that can be used right out of the box\&. The following brief information can be used to craft a homebrewed mail filter to take
\fBmaildrop\fR\*(Aqs place\&.
.PP
The local mail filter only works for addresses that correspond to local accounts\&. This filtering is not used if the recipient is a remote address on another mail server\&. The local mail filter is disabled by default\&. To enable local mail filtering you will need to initialize the
@sysconfdir@/maildropfilter
configuration file to contain the pathname to your local mail filter\&.
.PP
Local mail filtering is performed in two distinct phases:
.PP
Recipient filters
.RS 4
When the
Courier
mail server receives an address naming a local mail recipient, the local mail recipient\*(Aqs mail filter is executed before the
Courier
mail server acknowledges the address\&. The local mail filter tells the
Courier
mail server whether to: A) accept message unconditionally \- the message is whitelisted; B) reject the message unconditionally \- the
Courier
mail server tells the other mail server that the recipient address is invalid; or C) accept this recipient, but run the content mail filter, once the message\*(Aqs contents are available\&.
.RE
.PP
Content filters
.RS 4
After receiving the contents of the message, the mail filter is executed again for any recipients whose recipient filters used the third option\&. The content filter can now examine the contents of the message, and indicate whether the message should be accepted or rejected\&. Content filtering is not available for alias addresses\&.
.RE
.PP
It should be noted that mail filtering is executed as an integral part of receiving a message from a remote mail server\&. If the message is rejected, the
Courier
mail server refuses to accept the message for delivery\&.
.PP
The local mail filter will be invoked as follows:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
HOME=$HOME FILTER \-D \fIuid/gid\fR \-M \fIfilter\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The local mail filter will NOT be invoked as root, so if it needs to access files in the recipient\*(Aqs account, it must be installed setuid to root (as
\fBmaildrop\fR
is installed by default)\&.
.PP
"\fIuid/gid\fR" is the recipient account\*(Aqs system userid and group id, respectively\&. The recipient account\*(Aqs home directory is placed in the
\fBHOME\fR
environment variable, prior to running
\fIFILTER\fR, and "\fIfilter\fR" is set as follows:
.PP
rcptfilter
.RS 4
The mail filter is invoked initially when the remote mail server specifies this address as a recipient\&.
\fIFILTER\fR
should terminate with one of the following exit codes: 0 \- this sender is acceptable; 99 \- this sender is acceptable, but I want to run the content filter for this the message; any other non\-zero exit code \- the sender is not acceptable, reject the message\&.
.RE
.PP
smtpfilter
.RS 4
If
\fIFILTER\fR
terminates with exit code
\fB99\fR,
\fIFILTER\fR
runs again with this parameter set to the word
smtpfilter\&. FILTER will be invoked once the message has been received from the remote mail server, but not yet acknowledged\&. If
\fIFILTER\fR
terminates with a non\-zero exit code, the message is rejected\&. If
\fIFILTER\fR
terminated with the exit code of zero, the message is accepted\&.
.RE
.PP
rcptfilter\-\fIext\fR, smtpfilter\-\fIext\fR
.RS 4
If the recipient created sub\-addresses \- see
\m[blue]\fB\fBdot-courier\fR(5)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
\- a dash followed by the subaddress "ext" is appended to the name of the filter\&.
.RE
.PP
rcptfilter\-alias\-\fIext\fR
.RS 4
This is how
\fIFILTER\fR
gets invoked if the address is a locally defined mail alias (ext is the alias name)\&.
.RE
.PP
The
rcptfilter
invocation must terminate with a zero exit code when the message originates from a mailing list or any other source that should be considered as "whitelisted"\&. This filtering model does not fit very well with some mail transfer protocols, so unless trusted sources are explicitly declared to be whitelisted, there is a remote possibility that the recipient will be removed from a mailing list because of a poorly\-written mail filter from some other recipient of the same message\&. The 0 return exit code (which is the implied default if no mail filtering is installed) protects the recipient from being adversely affected, in any way, by anyone else\*(Aqs mail filter\&.
.PP
The mail filters may print a diagnostic message before rejecting a message\&. The diagnostic message will be returned to the sending mail relay, where possible\&.
.PP
The mail filters inherit environment variables that describe the incoming mail\&. The following environment variables are provided by default:
.PP
\fBSENDER\fR
.RS 4
The return address on the message\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBTCPREMOTEHOST\fR, \fBTCPREMOTEIP\fR
.RS 4
When the message is received via ESMTP, these variables specify the remote IP address and the corresponding hostname\&. Hostname is empty if the IP address does not have a reverse DNS record, or is set to "softdnserr" if there was a temporary failure while looking up this IP address\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBBLOCK2\fR
.RS 4
The default the
Courier
mail server configuration sets this environment variable if the remote IP address is listed in an unsecured relay blacklist\&. See
@sysconfdir@/esmtpd
for more information\&. Other environment variables may also be available\&. For mail received via ESMTP, environment variables are usually set in the
@sysconfdir@/smtpaccess
configuration file\&.
.RE
.SS "maildrop implementation"
.PP
Maildrop implements this mail filtering API as follows:
.PP
$HOME/\&.mailfilters
.RS 4
This directory contains the filtering recipes\&. This directory, and its contents, cannot have any group or world permissions\&.
.RE
.PP
smtpfilter*, rcptfilter*
.RS 4
These mail filtering recipes directly correspond to the events defined in the previous section\&. Maildrop\*(Aqs "import" statement can be used to gain access to the environment variables (these mail filters are executed in
\fBmaildrop\fR\*(Aqs embedded mode)\&. The mail filtering recipes can set the
\fBEXITCODE\fR
variable appropriately before terminating, in order to accept or reject the message\&.
.RE
.PP
See
\m[blue]\fB\fBmaildrop\fR(1)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2
for more information\&.
.SS "Filtering mail to aliases"
.PP
The
@sysconfdir@/aliases
configuration file is used to mail aliases, see
\m[blue]\fB\fBmakealiases\fR(8)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[3]\d\s+2\&. The system administrator may set aside a reserved local account that will be used to specify a local mail filter for messages addressed to aliases\&. The configuration file
@sysconfdir@/aliasfilteracct
specifies the home directory of the mail account that will be used to filter alias recipients\&.
.PP
For example, if
@sysconfdir@/aliasfilteracct
contains
/home/admin, then the
Courier
mail server runs the mail filter as follows:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
HOME=/home/admin FILTER \-D \fIuid/gid\fR \-M rcptfilter\-alias\-\fIname\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Here, "uid/gid" is owner uid and gid of the specified directory NOTE: "name" is a fully qualified address, and the local aliases listed in
@sysconfdir@/aliases
do not typically include the domain name\&. If defines an alias called "system", for example, the
\fB\-M\fR
option will probably be "system@example\&.com", if
example\&.com
is the contents of
@sysconfdir@/me
configuration file\&.
.PP
Unfortunately, currently it is not possible to specify content filters (a\&.k\&.a\&. smtpfilters) for aliases, only recipient filters\&.
