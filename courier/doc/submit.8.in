.SH "NAME"
submit \- Submit a new message to the Courier mail server
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fB@bindir@/submit\fR\ 'u
\fB@bindir@/submit\fR [\-expn=\fIaddress\fR] [\-vrfy=\fIaddress\fR] [\-vhost=\fIaddress\fR] [\-bcc] [\-delay=\fIn\fR] {module} {"\fItype\fR;\ \fIhostid\fR"}
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBsubmit\fR
program submits messages to the
Courier
mail server for processing\&. The
\fBsubmit\fR
program is not intended to be invoked by the end user\&. It is used by the
Courier
mail server input modules only\&. The
\fBsubmit\fR
program\*(Aqs global read and execute permissions are turned off, so that it can only be executed by a process that\*(Aqs a member of the
@mailgroup@
group\&.
\fBsubmit\fR
is installed in the
@libexecdir@/courier
directory\&.
.PP
\fBsubmit\fR
always takes two command line arguments after any options:
.PP
module
.RS 4
This argument identifies the module that\*(Aqs running the
\fBsubmit\fR
command\&. It must be one of the module names that the
Courier
mail server knows about, such as
local, or
esmtp\&. This argument determines address rewriting rules\&.
.RE
.PP
"\fItype\fR; \fIhostid\fR"
.RS 4
This single argument identifies the source of the message, and must be suitable for the Remote\-MTA: header in delivery status notifications, as specified by RFC 1894\&. For messages that are received via ESMTP, this argument is typically "dns; helohost (hostname [ip\&.address])"\&.
.RE
.PP
The
\fBsubmit\fR
program takes the following options:
.PP
\-expn=\fIaddress\fR
.RS 4
Do not accept a message, instead "expand" the given address\&. If the specified address matches a locally\-defined alias,
\fBsubmit\fR
prints the addresses this address expands to\&. If the specified address does not match a locally\-defined alias, the address is displayed by itself\&.
.RE
.PP
\-vrfy=\fIaddress\fR
.RS 4
Do not accept a message, instead verify the given address\&.
\fBsubmit\fR
prints a suitable message and sets the exit code to indicate whether the specified address is valid, or not\&. If the address matches a local alias,
\fBsubmit\fR
will indicate a valid address, and exit\&. If the address does not match a local alias,
\fBsubmit\fR
checks if this address is deliverable by any output protocol module\&. If so,
\fBsubmit\fR
will indicate a valid address, and exit\&. Otherwise,
\fBsubmit\fR
prints a "User unknown" error message, and exits\&.
.RE
.PP
\-bcc
.RS 4
If no recipients are given, obtain the list of recipients from
Bcc:
headers only\&. Normally, if no recipients are specified,
\fBsubmit\fR
reads the list of recipients from the
To:,
Cc:
and
Bcc:
headers (Bcc:
headers are always removed)\&. The
\-bcc
option ignores
To:
and
Cc:
headers for this purpose\&. This option is ignored if an explicit recipient list is specified (see below)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-delay=\fIn\fR
.RS 4
Wait
\fIn\fR
seconds before delivering the message\&. If not specified, delivery begins after waiting the amount of time specified by the
@sysconfdir@/submitdelay
configuration time (default: 0 seconds \-\- immediate delivery)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-vhost=\fIaddress\fR
.RS 4
Append
\(lq\&.\fIaddress\fR\(rq
to names of all configuration files Courier reads while processing this message\&.
.RE
.SH "RESPONSES FROM SUBMIT"
.PP
All replies from
\fBsubmit\fR
follow the format of SMTP responses, as defined in RFC822\&.
.PP
To summarize: the responses are one or more lines long\&. Every line in the response instead of the last one consists of a three\-digit numerical code, a dash, then arbitrary text\&. The last line (or the only line of the response) starts with a three\-digit numerical code, a single space, and arbitrary text\&. The first digit of the numerical code indicates whether the response indicates success, or failure\&. If the first digit is 5, the response indicates a permanent failure\&. If the first digit is 4, the response indicates a temporary failure (the message or the address should be resubmitted later)\&. If the first digit is not 4 or 5, the response indicates success, or acceptance\&.
.SH "MESSAGE SUBMISSION"
.PP
Unless either
\fB\-expn\fR
or
\fB\-vrfy\fR
option is specified,
\fBsubmit\fR
reads the message envelope and contents from standard input, as follows\&. All input and output to
\fBsubmit\fR
consists of newline\-terminated (NOT carriage return/newline terminated) lines of text\&.
.PP
\fBsubmit\fR
reads the first line of text, which specifies the envelope sender address\&. The line is formatted as follows:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
address<tab>format<tab>envid
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
<tab>
is the ASCII tab character\&. The address may be an empty string, optionally followed by tab, then "format", another tab, then "envid"\&.
.PP
\fIformat\fR
is one or more chatacters that specify delivery status notification processing, and other message options\&. The \*(AqF\*(Aq character specifies that delivery status notifications should include the entire message, \*(AqH\*(Aq specifies just the headers of the message should be included\&. Absence of either \*(AqF\*(Aq or \*(AqH\*(Aq specifies no preference\&. "S{keyword}" specifies the optional SECURITY extension keyword for this message\&. The \*(AqV\*(Aq character in
\fIformat\fR
sets the VERP extension flag for this message\&.
.PP
\fIenvid\fR
is the original message envelope ID, that will be shown on any delivery status notifications\&. NOTE:
\fIenvid\fR
must be specified using xtext encoding (see the relevant RFCs)\&.
.PP
After reading the first line of text,
\fBsubmit\fR
prints a response (see "RESPONSES FROM SUBMIT", above)\&. If the response is a failure,
\fBsubmit\fR
terminates immediately\&. Otherwise,
\fBsubmit\fR
then reads one or more envelope recipients\&.
.PP
Each envelope recipient is read as a single non\-empty line of text, formatted as follows:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
address<tab>dsn<tab>orecipient
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
\fIaddress\fR
is a non\-empty recipient E\-mail address, optionally followed by the tab character, then zero or more characters specifying
\fIdsn\fR, then a tab character, then the
\fIorecipient\fR
value\&.
.PP
\fIdsn\fR
is zero or more of the following characters: S \- send a delivery status notification upon a successful delivery to this address, F \- send a DSN upon a failed delivery, D \- send a DSN upon a mail delay, N \- never send a DSN\&.
\fIorecipient\fR
is the "Original Recipient", as specified in RFC1894, using xtext encoding\&.
.PP
\fBsubmit\fR
will print a response to each recipient (see "RESPONSES FROM SUBMIT", above)\&. If at least one recipient address has been succesfully specified, a blank line is read to specify end of recipient list, which is followed by the entire message, headers and body\&.
.PP
A single blank line terminates the list of recipients\&. That is followed by the message itself, until end of file\&.
.PP
The blank line can be present before even a the first recipient is specified\&. If so,
\fBsubmit\fR
obtains the list of recipient from the message\*(Aqs headers\&.
.PP
\fBsubmit\fR
reads the message headers and body until end\-of\-file\&. Then,
\fBsubmit\fR
prints a response (see above), indicating whether or not the message was accepted for delivery, and terminates\&.
.SH "ADDRESS REWRITING"
.PP
Each recipient address (whether specified explicitly, or obtained from the message headers), will be rewritten according to the rewriting rules specified by the input module\&. Each address in the headers of the message will also be rewritten\&.
.PP
After rewriting each recipient address,
\fBsubmit\fR
will search the aliases\&.dat file for this address, to see if it represents a locally defined alias\&. Submit searches
@libexecdir@/courier/modules/\fImodule\fR/aliases\&.dat
and
@sysconfdir@/aliases\&.dat
(actual locations may be changed by the system administrator)\&. If the address is found, the recipient address will be replaced by the addresses defined in the
aliases\&.dat
file\&.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.PP
\fBsubmit\fR
also reads the following environment variables to further specify how the message is to be processed:
.PP
BLOCK
.RS 4
If this variable is set to a non\-empty value, submit will reject every recipient (in effect, rejecting the message)\&. The contents of the environment variable will be used as the error message\&.
.RE
.PP
DSNENVID
.RS 4
If envid is not specified, or is blank, and this environment variable is defined, the contents of this variable is used as the original envelope id field for DSNs\&. Note that DSNENVID is copied verbatim into the Original\-Envelope\-Id field (if the message is relayed to another MTA, the
Courier
mail server automatically xtext\-encodes it)\&.
.RE
.PP
DSNNOTIFY
.RS 4
If the dsn field for a recipient is empty, the contents of this environment variable is used in its place\&. Also, if the recipient list is read from the headers, the contents of this environment variable are used to set the dsn setting\&.
.RE
.PP
DSNRET
.RS 4
If the format field for this message is empty, the contents of this environment variable is used in its place\&.
.RE
.PP
NOADDDATE
.RS 4
Normally the
Courier
mail server adds a
Date:
header to the message, if it does not have one\&. If this environment variable is set, the
Courier
mail server will not add a
Date:
header\&.
.RE
.PP
NOADDMSGID
.RS 4
Normally the
Courier
mail server adds a
Message\-Id:
header to the message, if it does not have it\&. If this environment variable is set, the
Courier
mail server will not add a
Message\-Id:
header\&.
.RE
.PP
NOADDRREWRITE
.RS 4
Normally the
Courier
mail server rewrites addresses in the
From:,
To:, and
Cc:
header fields\&. If this environment variable is set to
1, the
Courier
mail server will not rewrite them\&. If it is set to a higher value, the
Courier
mail server will only rewrite it if no
DKIM\-Signature:
header field was found\&.
.RE
.PP
MIME
.RS 4
Normally the
Courier
mail server adds any missing RFC2045 headers to the message\&. The
\fBMIME\fR
environment variable can be set to the following values:
none
\- do not do any RFC2045 processing whatsoever;
7bit
\- if the message contains any 8\-bit text, convert it to
quoted\-printable
encoding;
8bit
\-if the message contains any quoted\-printable encoded text that can be representing as 8bit\-encoded text, then convert it to 8bit encoding\&.
