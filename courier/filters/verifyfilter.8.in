.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This is a mail filter/tool combination that tries to determine the validity of E\-mail addresses by attempting to contact the mail domain\*(Aqs mail server, and executing a
\fBRCPT TO\fR
command\&. There are three ways to use this tool\&.

\fBverifyfilter\fR
is suitable for handling moderate amount of E\-mail traffic\&. Address validation is expensive, requiring a DNS lookup and an outbound connection to a mail server for every validated address\&.
\fBverifyfilter\fR
goes through the same steps that the mail server does when sending mail, including enabling of encryption\&.
.PP
\fBverifyfilter\fR
uses logging and caching, to avoid repeatedly validating the same return address when receiving multiple E\-mails from the same sender; but its caching is rudimentary (a simple log file), and increased logging due to high E\-mail traffic mail delivery may create large log files, impacting performance\&.
.SS "The verifysmtp command"
.HP \w'\fB@bindir@/verifysmtp\fR\ 'u
\fB@bindir@/verifysmtp\fR {user@domain}
.PP
The
\fBverifysmtp\fR
command creates a network connection to
\fIdomain\fR\*(Aqs mail server, and checks if it considers the given E\-mail address as valid\&. Two or more E\-mail addresses can be given, and each E\-mail address gets checked individually\&.
.PP
\fBverifysmtp\fR
terminates with a zero exit code if all given E\-mail addresses passed\&. A non\-zero exit code indicates that one or more of the given addresses were rejected\&.
.SS "The verifyfilter global mail filter"
.HP \w'\fBfilterctl\fR\ 'u
\fBfilterctl\fR {[start] | [stop]} verifyfilter
.PP
The
\fBverifyfilter\fR
global mail filter, if enabled, checks each message\*(Aqs return address\&. The E\-mail message gets rejected if its return address\*(Aqs mail server rejects the return address\&. There\*(Aqs not much sense in accepting mail if its return address is undeliverable\&.
.PP
\fBverifyfilter\fR
ignores messages from authenticated senders, and does not check their return addresses\&.

This alternative provides comparable functionality as the global mail filter, but exposed via the
\m[blue]\fB\fBlocalmailfilter\fR(7)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
API\&.
.PP
With maildrop, a protected wrapper filtering recipe gets installed into
@sysconfdir@/maildroprcs/verifysender, which invokes
\fBverifysmtp\fR
via
\fBmaildrop\fR\*(Aqs
\fBsystem\fR
command\&. The wrapper must be included in this manner, since
\fBmaildrop\fR
normally does not allow the
\fBsystem\fR
command in the embedded execution mode that\*(Aqs used by the local mail filtering API\&.
.PP
The wrapper executes
\fBverifysmtp\fR
with a special argument, a single
\(lq\&.\(rq\&. This is a special parameter that indicates that
\fBverifysmtp\fR
should read the E\-mail address from the
\fISENDER\fR
environment variable (avoiding issues with shell expansion, and script kiddies)\&.
.PP
The
@sysconfdir@/maildroprcs/verifysender
wrapper can be suitably, perhaps optionally, included from either the
rcptfilter
or the
smtpfilter
script\&.
.SS "Logging and caching"
.PP
\fBverifyfilter\fR
caches the return address it checks\&. Once
\fBverifyfilter\fR
verifies that the return address is accepted by the sending domain\*(Aqs mail server, this is logged and additional E\-mail with the same return address gets immediately accepted without contacting the sending domain\*(Aqs mail server to re\-check the same address\&.
.PP
Successfully verified return addresses get cached for approximately 2\-3 hours\&. If no other E\-mail with the same address get received before the cache expires that return address gets rechecked the next time it is seen\&. If another E\-mail with the same return address gets received, it is immediately accepted and the email address gets recached\&. Most mailing lists\*(Aq bounce addresses should not cause excessive re\-verification, provided a regular trickle of mailing list traffic\&. This includes mailing list that use per\-message bounce addresses that follow the common VERP convention (Variable Envelope Return Path), see
\(lqFILES\(rq
below\&.
.PP
As becomes obvious after perusing the contents of the stock
verifysender
local mail filter,
\fBverifysmtp\fR\*(Aqs
\fB\-t\fR
gives the name of a scratch directory that
\fBverifysmtp\fR
uses for the cache\&. This directory should be set aside for
\fBverifysmtp\fR, and not used for other purposes\&. The global mail filter shares the scratch directory together with other
Courier
functions that work the same way\&.
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
Just because a mail server accepted the
\fBRCPT TO\fR
it does not mean that the given E\-mail address can ultimately receive E\-mail\&.
.PP
When executed as a shell command or a local recipient mail filter the
Courier
mail server\*(Aqs execution environment is not available, and
\fBverifysmtp\fR
will not be able to use
Courier\*(Aqs configuration files, such as
smtproutes
and
authclient, and several others\&. As such,
\fBverifysmtp\fR\*(Aqs behavior might differ from Courier\*(Aqs, when sending mail\&.
.SH "FILES"
.PP
\fBverifyfilter\fR
uses the following configuration files\&. Changes to the following files do not take effect until the filter has been stopped and restarted\&.
.PP
@sysconfdir@/filters/verifyfilter\-mode
.RS 4
If this file exists and contains the word "all",
\fBverifyfilter\fR
will create its socket in
@localstatedir@/allfilters, otherwise the socket will be created in
@localstatedir@/filters, see
\m[blue]\fB\fBcourierfilter\fR(8)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2
for more information\&.
.RE
.PP
@sysconfdir@/filters/verifyfilter\-logmode
.RS 4
This file contains a single line,
\(lqbase\(rq
or
\(lqfull\(rq\&.
\(lqfull\(rq
verifies each return address, exactly as given\&. The default
\(lqbase\(rq
value strips off any VERP component of the sender\*(Aqs address, before comparing it\&. If the local mailbox portion of the return address contains a dash, the dash and the remaining portion of the return address gets removed\&.
.sp
With the default
\(lqbase\(rq
logging mode, once the E\-mail address
<list\-12@example\&.com>
gets verified, all further addresses like
<list\-13@example\&.com>
and
<list\-foo\-bar@example\&.com>
are considered as verified, but not
<anotherlist@example\&.com>\&.
