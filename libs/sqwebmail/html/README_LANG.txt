                        SqWebMail Language translations

   Starting with version 0.23, SqWebMail includes configuration scripts in
   the html subdirectory (the one where you found this file) which make it
   possible to be able to add translated HTML templates to SqWebMail very
   easily. You will be able to create and maintain the translated HTML
   templates all by yourself.

   Before you set up a translated HTML template set, you will need to have
   the following information:

     * ISO code/locality for your translation. For example, I distribute
       SqWebMail with the HTML templates for en-us - English-US. If, for
       example, you wanted to create an HTML template set for
       English-British, your ISO code/locality would be en-gb. If you wanted
       to create an HTML template set for French, your ISO code/locality
       would be fr-fr, and so on.

     * Locale code. This is the name of the i18n locale that's installed on
       your system. The locale primarily determines how dates are displayed.
       It is usually very similar to the ISO code/locality. For example, the
       i18n locale for English-US is en_US, for English-British it's en_GB,
       for French it's fr_FR. Try checking for the LOCALE environment
       variable, the manual page for locale(7), or the contents of
       /usr/share/locale directory.

     * The MIME character set. This specifies the character set of messages
       in this language. For most european languages, it is iso-8859-1.

     * The name of the ispell dictionary for your language. For example, for
       English-US, the corresponding ispell dictionary is called "american",
       for German, it's "german".

Extract sqwebmail, and run configure

   First, you want to take the standard sqwebmail-0.23.tar.gz tarball, and
   extract it, then run the configure script with your usual options:

   $ tar xzvf sqwebmail-0.23.tar.gz
   $ cd sqwebmail-0.23
   $ ./configure [ your usual options go here ]

   Change to the html subdirectory.

   $ cd html

   The standard sqwebmail-@VERSION.tar.gz includes the subdirectory
   html/en-us. Let's say you want to translate it into French.

   The ISO code/locality is fr-fr.

   The locale code is fr_FR.

   The ispell dictionary name is "french".

   The first thing that needs to be done is to create another subdirectory in
   html. The name of the subdirectory must be the ISO code/locality for the
   language.

   You don't have to do it by hand. There's a special target in html/Makefile
   that will do it for you!

   $ make clone from=en-us to=fr-fr

   This script takes the Makefile, the configure script, and other files from
   the html/en-us subdirectory, and creates the html/fr-fr subdirectory which
   will temporary contain the mirror image of the html/en-us subdirectory.

Setting LANGUAGE_PREF

   You now have to make minor changes to some files in the fr-fr
   subdirectory. fr-fr/LANGUAGE will be automatically created by the make
   clone script. However, you must initialize the contents of the
   fr-fr/LANGUAGE_PREF file:

   $ echo fr50 fr-fr >fr-fr/LANGUAGE_PREF

   The LANGUAGE_PREF file must contain exactly one line with two words. The
   second word must always be the ISO code/locality. The first word is used
   to sort all the installed HTML templates alphabetically by ISO
   code/locality, and it's used to selecte the preferred locality within the
   same ISO code.

   For example, the contents of en-us/LANGUAGE_PREF is "en50 en-us". Let's
   say you want to have both en-us and en-gb HTML templates. If you want
   clients requesting the "en" HTML to receive the en-gb HTML, you will have
   to set en-gb/LANGUAGE_PREF to something like "en40 en-gb":

   $ echo en40 en-gb >en-gb/LANGUAGE_PREF

   If you want clients requesting the "en" HTML to receive the en-us HTML,
   you will have to do something like this:

   $ echo en60 en-gb >en-gb/LANGUAGE_PREF

   The first word in all the LANGUAGE_PREF files is used to sort the list of
   all the available HTML templates, and the sorted list is used to select
   the preferred locality within the same ISO code.

Setting LOCALE

   Let's resume the example with the French translation. The next file that
   needs to be changed is LOCALE. This file contains the locale code for the
   language. For French, the locale code is fr_FR:

   $ echo fr_FR >fr-fr/LOCALE

Setting CHARSET

   The CHARSET file sets the MIME character set of outgoing messages. For US
   and most european languages, this value should be iso-8859-1

   $ echo iso-8859-1 >fr-fr/CHARSET

Setting ISPELLDICT

   Finally, you need to specify which dictionary ispell will use for spell
   checking. For French, the dictionary is simply named "french":

   $ echo french >fr-fr/ISPELLDICT

   If you do not have an ispell dictionary for this language, initialize
   ISPELLDICT with the name of the default dictionary.

Rerunning the configure script

   You now need to rerun the configure script in the main sqwebmail
   directory:

   $ cd ..
   $ ./configure [ options ]

   This reruns the configure script in the sqwebmail-0.23 directory, which
   will now pick up your new html/fr-fr subdirectory, which will be
   configured in.

Creating the actual translations

   Now, you can edit all the .html files in html/fr-fr, and replace all
   English text with its French equivalent.

   If you now do a make, followed by make install, the installation script
   will install both the original en-us HTML templates and fr-fr HTML
   templates together.

   If you now run make dist:

   $ make dist

   This will create a new sqwebmail-0.23.tar.gz tarball, containing both sets
   of HTML templates, which you can now distribute!

Updating translations for new versions of SqWebMail

   Well, what should you do when a new version of SqWebMail is available?

   First, you need to determine whether or not there were any changes to the
   contents of the html/en-us subdirectory. Then, you will have to apply the
   same changes to the translated contents of the old html/fr-fr
   subdirectory.

   Then, repeat the previous procedure for the new version of SqWebMail, but
   before running the configure script for the second time, copy all the
   .html files from the previous version of SqWebMail (plus any changes or
   new files) into the html/fr-fr subdirectory of the new version.
