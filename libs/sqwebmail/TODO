                Things yet to do (not in any particular order).

     * Address book.

     * Support Multipart-Related:, and the associated verbiage. ... But,
       like, who cares?

     * Write an online-manual/help.

     * Complete multibyte support. Currently when we truncate sender
       names/subjects, we don't take into account multibyte characters. When
       glibc can provide more functionality (a'la mbnextc, mbprevc), I'll
       implement it.

     * Translate HTML into another language. Hey, multi-lingual support is
       already here, just dump your stuff under html, and make sure your
       browser sends me the right Accept Language tag.

     * Content-ID: Support
